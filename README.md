Simple Song Recommendation System
=================================

Using Big Data Analysis, this application recommends person songs based on the songs one likes by implementing Apriori Algorithm & Naive-Bayes Algorithm.

Apriori Algorithm
=================

Aprior is used for frequent itemset mining and association rule learning over transactional databases. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those itemsets appear sufficiently often in the database. The frequent item sets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database.


Naive Bayes 
============
A naive Bayes classifier assumes that the value of a particular feature is unrelated to the presence or absence of any other feature, given the class variable. For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 3" in diameter. A naive Bayes classifier considers each of these features to contribute independently to the probability that this fruit is an apple, regardless of the presence or absence of the other features.



Flow chart of the codes :

1.php | | (after selection of songs) | | 2.php---------------if the number of songs displayed are less then the min value, go ahead & display--3.php | more songs | | | (review the selection) | | | | |
5.php-----------------------------------------review the selection------------------------------------4.php | | (feedback system) | | 6.php
